// Assert module in Node.js provides a bunch of facilities that are useful for the assertion of the function. The assert module provides a set of assertion functions for verifying invariants. If the condition is true it will output nothing else an assertion error is given by the console.

// Install the assert module using the following command:

// npm install assert
// Note: Installation is an optional step as it is inbuilt Node.js module.
