// Node.js is an open source server-side Javascript run-time environment built on Chrome’s JavaScript Engine(V8). Node.js is used for building fast and scalable applications and is an event driven, non-blocking I/O model.

// REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP) is a computer environment similar to Shell (Unix/Linux) and command prompt. Node comes with the REPL environment when it is installed. System interacts with the user through outputs of commands/expressions used. It is useful in writing and debugging the codes. The work of REPL can be understood from its full form:

// Read : It reads the inputs from users and parses it into JavaScript data structure. It is then stored to memory.
// Eval : The parsed JavaScript data structure is evaluated for the results.
// Print : The result is printed after the evaluation.
// Loop : Loops the input command. To come out of NODE REPL, press ctrl+c twice

// Getting Started with REPL:
// To start working with REPL environment of NODE; open up the terminal (in case of UNIX/LINUX) or the Command prompt (in case of Windows) and write node and press ‘enter’ to start the REPL.
